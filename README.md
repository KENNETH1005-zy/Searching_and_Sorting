An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Problem statement
Given an array of strings that contains anagrams, write a function to print those anagrams.

Input
The input is an array of strings. Remember that spaces count as characters! So " abc" and “cab” are technically not anagrams since " abc" has spaces which “cab” does not.

Output
The output is a string where all the anagrams are grouped together.
